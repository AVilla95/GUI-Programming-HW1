                Noctua is Dante's fully customizable book granted to him while using his first ability, 
                Noctua. It fires a single rate of fire blast that explodes on contact with the enemy. 
                As you continue landing hits on the enemy, it builds up a secondary meter located below 
                the player's crosshair. When this meter is filled to it's maximum, the special fire 
                button can be pressed to launch a large projectile that can infinitely phase through 
                enemies and obstacles for up to 30 meters.
            </p>

            <p>
                In addition to being a powerful weapon, it also can be customized using specific 
                modifications unique to the Book weapon type called Canticle mods.
