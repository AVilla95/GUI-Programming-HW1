    <p>Noctua is Dante's fully customizable book granted to him while using his first ability, 
        Noctua. It fires a single rate of fire blast that explodes on contact with the enemy. 
        As you continue landing hits on the enemy, it builds up a secondary meter located below 
        the player's crosshair. When this meter is filled to it's maximum, the special fire 
        button can be pressed to launch a large projectile that can infinitely phase through 
        enemies and obstacles for up to 30 meters.
    </p>

    <p>
        In addition to being a powerful weapon, it also can be customized using specific 
        modifications unique to the Book weapon type.
