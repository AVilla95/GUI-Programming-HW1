Description: A webpage dedicated to Dante's ultimate ability, Final Verse. Due to
the ability having 4 different variations based off of combinations, the webpage contains
a table showing each combination and recordings of them. Included a legend above
the table for reference.

The recording for Triumph and Tragedy could be better to showcase the effects better.
Ex: Displaying UI for Triumph and using Tragedy in front of enemies.

Source: Icon, ability description, and recorded are from the game, Warframe. Icon and ability
description are copied off of the wiki.

        <p>
            After Dante unleashes his mighty spells through both his Light Verse and Dark Verse abilities,
            he can use their combined power to unleash an ultimate ability called Final Verse. Depending
            on the combination of abilities he's stocked up, they can create 1 of 4 different effects.
