Description: A webpage that contains each of the character's abilities icons, a description
and a gif (I created) from the game Warframe. Recorded the footage and converted it into gifs.

The gif for Light Verse is a bit too short but I don't want to re-record it.

Source: Icons, ability descriptions, and footage recorded from the game Warframe. Everything but the
footage was stuff taken from the game's wiki. The footage was recorded by myself.
