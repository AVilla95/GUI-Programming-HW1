		<!-- Character's story -->
		<h2>Story</h2>
		<p class="story">
			General

			Dante served as scribe and historian who worked with Entrati. Additionally, he was the main chronicler of the Leverian, a 
			little-known museum named after Drusus Leverian, it's curator. A student of history and avid seeker of knowledge, Dante soon 
			became close friends with both Drusus and Albrecht Entrati's assistant, Loid. Due to his nature as a Warframe, Dante was 
			unable to speak with a conventional voice; instead, he spoke through his writing, and his voice was indeed beautiful. A 
			natural scholar, Dante possessed an affinity for knowledge, and often shared the Entrati's interest with bones and the dead. 
			He even went on to publish some of the finest works detailing ancient Earth archaeology, something that was considered 
			impossible for a mere Warframe to accomplish. Dante was one of the few warframes who didn't immediately go mad and join in 
			the Warframe Insurrection. However, he became a wanted fugitive. Dante's Investigation. When Albrecht disappeared, Dante 
			became eager to unveil the mystery behind the disappearance. Despite promising Drusus otherwise, he ventured into Albrecht's 
			Laboratories against his friend's wishes. Within the hauntingly silent halls, Dante encountered the lab's malfunctioning 
			Necramechs; all acting violent and chanting in eldritch Voidtongue. As Drusus watched, the wrong-tongued dialect began to 
			worm into Dante's mind, tempting him with his one weakness; the promise of knowledge. He had discovered The Book, an unknown, 
			unearthly tome of knowledge that was laid as a trap by The Indifference as an attempt to seize control of him. As Dante 
			struggled to resist its knowledge, he heard his dear friend say, "Dante, what you have found can never be brought forth. 
			Parvos must never know of this. "Thus, Dante gave up, allowing himself to succumb to the Book's influence and take his life. 
			However, the Book and the hellish words within did not allow Dante to die, and instead altered the very fabric of who the 
			Warframe was. Transported to stars unknown, that wrong-tongued Voice now murmurs endlessly within his head, longing to be 
			known, to exist, and to survive.
